# README

This is the backend of the "Ideahub" website. First, once the repo is cloned and opened, run `bundle install` to instantiate all of the gems required for the application to work. Then, as this application is not yet hosted, make sure you migrate the database, as well as seed it. Once that is done, run `rails s` in the console, and continue to the frontend README.md to get the app up and running.

Enjoy!
